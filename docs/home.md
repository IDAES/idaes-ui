# Getting Started

The Institute for the Design of Advanced Energy Systems Integrated Platform (IDAES-IP) consists of high-level capabilities that solve complex design and optimization problems with the core IDAES software framework, which makes use of state of the art equation-oriented optimization  solvers. For more details on these components, see the
<a href="https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">IDAES documentation</a>

## Installation

1. *Install IDAES*. The IDAES UI depends on IDAES, so you must first install the main IDAES package. See the <a href="https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/getting_started/index.html" target="_blank">installation instructions</a> in the IDAES documentation.
2. *Install idaes-ui*. Most users will want to install the latest release from PyPI with this command:
    ```shell
   pip install idaes-ui
   ```
    To get the latest pre-release version, install directly from the GitHub repository with:  
  `pip install git+https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-ui`

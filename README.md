## Overview

This repository contains user interfaces for the [Institute for the Design of Advanced Energy Systems (IDAES)](https://idaes.org) Integrated Platform (IDAES-IP).

The primary user interface is the **Flowsheet Visualizer** (FV),
which is a web-based user interface that can visualize and explore the
properties of computational models ("flowsheets") created using the IDAES
Python APIs.

## Installation

IDAES-UI is installed as part of the IDAES Integrated Platform (IDAES-IP).
Please see the README of the [IDAES-PSE repository](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse) and/or the full [IDAES install instructions](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/getting_started/index.html) for details. 
In a nutshell, you want to add `'ui'` to the list of dependencies when you run the main IDAES-IP installation command (*pip* or *conda*).
